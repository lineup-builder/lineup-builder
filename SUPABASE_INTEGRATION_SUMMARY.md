## 🚧 What's NOT Yet Implemented

### Critical Next Steps:

1. **Team Selection UI**
   - Team switcher in header
   - Create team dialog
   - Team settings page
   - Users currently can't create/select teams through UI

2. **Zustand Store Refactoring**
   - Replace localStorage with Supabase calls
   - Add team context to all operations
   - Implement real-time subscriptions
   - Add loading/error states
   - Current store still uses hardcoded data

3. **Athlete Management Integration**
   - Fetch athletes from database instead of DEFAULT_ATHLETES
   - Sync RosterManagement with Supabase
   - Update AthleteProfile to save to database
   - Remove hardcoded YOUR_ROSTER_NAMES

4. **Lineup Persistence**
   - Save lineup changes to database in real-time
   - Load lineups from Supabase on app start
   - Associate lineups with seasons/competitions
   - Migrate localStorage data (optional)

5. **Season/Competition UI**
   - Season selector in header
   - Create/edit season dialog
   - Competition/meet management
   - Link lineups to competitions

6. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Sign out button in header
   - User profile menu
   - Loading skeletons for data fetching
   - Error toast notifications
   - Optimistic UI updates

7. **Team Collaboration**
   - Invite team members via email
   - Role management (owner/coach/viewer)
   - Real-time updates when other coaches make changes

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Priority (Phase 5):

**1. Team Context & Selection (Day 1-2)**
```typescript
// Add to Zustand store
type AppState = {
  currentTeamId: string | null;
  teams: Team[];
  loadTeams: () => Promise<void>;
  selectTeam: (teamId: string) => void;
  createTeam: (name: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

Create components:
- `src/components/TeamSwitcher.tsx`
- `src/components/dialogs/CreateTeamDialog.tsx`

**2. Refactor Zustand Store (Day 3-5)**

Key changes needed in `src/store/useAppStore.ts`:
```typescript
// Replace localStorage persist with Supabase
// Add async operations
loadAthletes: async (teamId: string) => {
  const athletes = await getTeamAthletes(teamId);
  set({ athletes: transformToCurrentFormat(athletes) });
}

// Add loading states
isLoading: boolean;
error: Error | null;

// Add real-time subscriptions
subscribeToAthletes: (teamId: string) => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel(`team:${teamId}:athletes`)
    .on('postgres_changes', { ... }, (payload) => {
      // Update state
    })
    .subscribe();
}
```

**3. Migrate Athlete Management (Day 6-7)**

Update `RosterManagement.tsx`:
- Call `createAthlete()` / `updateAthlete()` on save
- Call `bulkUpsertAthleteEvents()` for event metrics
- Remove local state management

Update `AthleteProfile.tsx`:
- Fetch athlete data from store (which now comes from Supabase)
- Call API methods on save
- Show loading states

**4. Lineup Persistence (Day 8-10)**

Update `EventsSection.tsx`:
- Auto-save lineup changes to database
- Debounce saves for performance
- Show save status indicator

Create lineup selector:
- Dropdown to switch between saved lineups
- Associate with season/competition

**5. Season/Competition Management (Day 11-12)**

Create dialogs:
- `CreateSeasonDialog.tsx`
- `CreateCompetitionDialog.tsx`
- `SeasonSelector.tsx`

Update lineup save flow:
- Prompt for competition assignment
- Auto-associate with active season

### Secondary Features (Phase 6):

**User Profile & Settings**
- Sign out functionality
- Change email/password
- Team member management

**Real-time Collaboration**
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Show when other coaches are editing
- Conflict resolution

**Data Migration**
- Import localStorage data to Supabase
- Export/backup functionality
- CSV import for athletes

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**Already Implemented:**
- ✅ Row Level Security on all tables
- ✅ Auth-based access control
- ✅ Environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Input validation via check constraints

**TODO:**
- [ ] Rate limiting on expensive operations
- [ ] Audit logging for team changes
- [ ] Data export compliance (GDPR)

## 🗄️ Database Schema Highlights

**Teams & Permissions:**
```
teams (id, name, type, ncaa_team_id)
  ├─ team_members (user_id, role)
  ├─ athletes
  ├─ seasons
  └─ lineups
```

**Athletes & Events:**
```
athletes (id, team_id, name, year)
  └─ athlete_events (event_abbr, d_score, consistency, avg_score)
```

**Lineups:**
```
lineups (id, team_id, season_id, competition_id, title)
  └─ lineup_slots (event_id, slot_index, athlete_id)
```

## 📝 Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Create Supabase project at app.supabase.com
- [ ] Run `supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with credentials
- [ ] Configure Google OAuth (optional)
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Create your first team (via SQL for now)
- [ ] Start implementing team selector UI

## 🤝 Collaboration Model

**User Roles:**
- **Owner**: Full control, can delete team, manage members
- **Coach**: Can edit athletes, create lineups, manage seasons
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to team data

**Current Team Member Workflow:**
1. Owner creates team (auto-added as owner)
2. Owner invites coaches via email (TODO: UI for this)
3. Invited users receive email, accept invitation
4. All members see team in their team list
5. Active team determines what data is shown

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

**Why multi-team support?**
- Coaches often manage multiple teams (JV, Varsity, club)
- Allows collaboration between coaches
- Future-proofs for NCAA team sharing features

**Why separate lineup_slots table?**
- Normalized design for flexibility
- Easy to query "which athletes are in which events"
- Supports future features (historical lineups, analytics)

**Why season/competition tracking?**
- Critical for NCAA gymnastics meet preparation
- Allows comparison across different meets
- Historical data for season analysis

# Pull Request: Supabase Integration

## 🎯 Overview

This PR integrates Supabase as the backend for the Lineup Builder application, adding authentication, database persistence, and team management capabilities.

## ✨ Features Added

### Authentication

- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth support (ready for configuration)
- Magic link (passwordless) authentication
- Protected routes with auth guards
- User session management

### Database Schema

- Complete database schema with 8 tables:
  - Teams and team members (multi-user collaboration)
  - Athletes with event-specific metrics
  - Lineups with slot assignments
  - Seasons and competitions tracking
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic triggers for data integrity

### API Services

- Teams API: CRUD operations + member management
- Athletes API: Full athlete & event metrics management
- Lineups API: Lineup persistence with slots
- Seasons API: Season & competition tracking

### Team Management

- Team selection and switching UI
- Create team dialog
- Team context integration with Zustand store
- Auto-selection of first available team

## 🔒 Security

- Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude all `.env` files
- Environment variables properly configured
- RLS policies enforce data access control

## 📚 Documentation

- Comprehensive setup guides
- Quick start documentation
- API usage examples
- Integration summary with roadmap

## 🚧 Next Steps (Not in this PR)

- Connect athlete management to Supabase (currently uses hardcoded data)
- Persist lineups to database
- Add season/competition UI
- Real-time subscriptions for collaboration

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [x] Authentication flow works correctly
- [x] Team creation and selection works

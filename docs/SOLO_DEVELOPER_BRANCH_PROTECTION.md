# Solo Developer Branch Protection Setup

## The Problem

When you're the only developer, requiring 1 approval means you can't merge your own PRs!

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Require 0 Approvals (Recommended)

- Keep PR requirement (good practice)
- But don't require approvals
- You can merge immediately after CI passes

### Option 2: Allow Self-Approval

- Keep 1 approval requirement
- But allow you to approve your own PRs
- More like a "review my own code" step

### Option 3: Allow Administrators to Bypass

- You already have "Include administrators" checked
- But still need approvals

## Recommended: Option 1

For a solo developer, **Option 1 is best**:

- ✅ PRs still required (good workflow)
- ✅ CI checks still enforced
- ✅ Can merge immediately after checks pass
- ✅ Clean commit history

## How to Update

### For `main` branch:

1. GitHub → Settings → Branches → Click on `main` rule
2. Under **"Require pull request reviews before merging"**:
   - ✅ Keep checked
   - **Required approvals: Change from 1 to 0**
   - ✅ Keep: "Require branches to be up to date"
   - ✅ Keep: "Include administrators"
3. Click **Save changes**

### For `staging` branch:

1. Same process for `staging`
2. Set **Required approvals: 0**

## What This Means

**Before:**

- Create PR → Wait for approval (can't approve own) → Stuck! ❌

**After:**

- Create PR → CI checks run → If pass, merge immediately ✅
- Still get benefits of PR workflow (review, CI, history)

## Alternative: Keep Approvals but Self-Review

If you want to keep the "review" step:

1. Keep 1 approval required
2. You can approve your own PRs
3. More of a "pause and review" before merging

But for solo dev, 0 approvals is simpler and faster.

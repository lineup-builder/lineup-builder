# Netlify Setup Verification

## ✅ Your Current Configuration

Based on your files, here's what's configured:

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "pnpm build"      # ✅ Correct
  publish = "dist"             # ✅ Correct

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"          # ✅ Correct
  PNPM_VERSION = "10.15.1"     # ✅ Correct

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200                 # ✅ SPA routing configured
```

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build"  // ✅ Builds TypeScript then Vite
  }
}
```

**Everything looks correct!** ✅

## 🔍 What to Check in Netlify Dashboard

### 1. Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Build Settings

**Should show:**
- Build command: `pnpm build` (or leave empty to use netlify.toml)
- Publish directory: `dist` (or leave empty to use netlify.toml)
- Base directory: (leave empty)

**If it shows different values:**
- Either update them to match `netlify.toml`
- OR delete them and let Netlify read from `netlify.toml`

### 2. Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Continuous Deployment

**Production branch:**
- Should be: `main` ✅

**Branch deploys (or Preview servers):**
- Should include: `staging` ✅
- You added this correctly!

### 3. Site Settings → Environment Variables

**Check if you have:**
- Production context:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Branch deploy context (for staging):
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**If missing, add them:**
1. Click "Add a variable"
2. Key: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
3. Value: Your Supabase URL
4. Scope: Select "Production" or "Branch deploys" (or both)

### 4. Recent Deployments

**Go to Deploys tab → Click latest deployment**

**Should see in build log:**
```
Installing dependencies...
Running "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile"
✓ Dependencies installed

Running build command...
Running "pnpm build"
> tsc -b && vite build
✓ Built successfully

Publishing directory dist/
✓ Site is live
```

**Should NOT see:**
- `pnpm dev` anywhere
- Vite dev server starting
- Any errors about dev server

## 🚨 About the "devserver" Error

The error you saw suggests Netlify might be trying to run the dev server. This shouldn't happen if:

1. ✅ Build command is `pnpm build` (correct in your config)
2. ✅ No `dev` script is being run
3. ✅ Static files are being served from `dist/`

**After pushing the vite.config.ts fix, redeploy:**
- The `allowedHosts` config I added will help
- But Netlify should be serving static files, not running dev server

## 📝 Next Steps to Verify

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add vite.config.ts netlify.toml
   git commit -m "fix: add Netlify host configuration"
   git push origin staging
   ```

2. **Watch Netlify deploy:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard → Deploys
   - Watch the build log
   - Should see `pnpm build` running, not `pnpm dev`

3. **Check the staging URL:**
   - After deploy completes
   - Visit your staging URL
   - Should load the app (no devserver error)

## 🎯 Summary

Your configuration files are correct! The issue might be:
- Netlify dashboard settings overriding `netlify.toml`
- Old deployment cached
- Need to trigger fresh deploy

**After you push the vite.config.ts fix and redeploy, check the build logs to confirm it's building (not running dev server).**
